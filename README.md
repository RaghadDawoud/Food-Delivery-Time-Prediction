# Food Delivery Time Prediction (### Using Linear Regression Model)üì¶

This project focuses on predicting food delivery times by leveraging a linear regression model. By examining key factors such as distance, weather conditions, traffic levels, and courier experience, the project aims to uncover patterns that influence delivery efficiency. The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights for optimizing food delivery services, improving customer satisfaction, and enhancing operational effectiveness.  

## About the Dataset üìä  
The dataset is designed to help predict food delivery times based on multiple influencing factors. It serves as an engaging challenge for machine learning practitioners, especially those interested in real-world applications.  

### Key Features:  
- **Order_ID**: Unique identifier for each order.  
- **Distance_km**: The delivery distance in kilometers.  
- **Weather**: Weather conditions during the delivery (Clear, Rainy, Snowy, Foggy, Windy).  
- **Traffic_Level**: Traffic conditions categorized as Low, Medium, or High.  
- **Time_of_Day**: Time of delivery categorized as Morning, Afternoon, Evening, or Night.  
- **Vehicle_Type**: Type of vehicle used for delivery (Bike, Scooter, Car).  
- **Preparation_Time_min**: Time required to prepare the order, measured in minutes.  
- **Courier_Experience_yrs**: Experience of the courier in years.  
- **Delivery_Time_min**: Total delivery time in minutes (target variable).  

## Project Goals üéØ  
- Build a linear regression model that accurately predicts delivery times.  
- Analyze the impact of various factors such as weather, traffic, and preparation time on delivery efficiency.  
- Provide insights for improving delivery logistics and reducing delivery delays.  


## Steps Involved üìù  
1. **Data Exploration**: Understanding the dataset and visualizing key trends.  
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numeric data.  
3. **Model Development**: Building and training a linear regression model to predict delivery times.  
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R¬≤ score.  



This project provided hands-on experience in predicting food delivery times using linear regression, focusing on key factors like distance, weather, traffic, and courier experience. It can be improved by incorporating more advanced models, additional features, and further tuning for better accuracy.
